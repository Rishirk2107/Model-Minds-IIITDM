# Life Redemption

Life Redemption is a project aimed at helping people who are addicted to drugs. It provides a community platform where individuals can share about living a drug-free life, and includes a chatbot for discussions about symptoms, positive stories, and the negative consequences of drug use. Additionally, there's a discussion page where recovering addicts can ask questions and receive answers from those who have overcome addiction.
